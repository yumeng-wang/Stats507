### Document description
In [PS2_Q3](./PS2_Q3.ipynb), I use `Pandas` to read and append the demographic datasets from the NHANES. Then I save the data frame to `pickle` format. Besides that, I read, clean and append the oral health and dentition data from the NHANES and save the data to `pickle` format. The purposes of these steps are practicing the use of `Pandas` package and preparing the data for future problem sets.
